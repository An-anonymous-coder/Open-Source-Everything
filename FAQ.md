This is an early look at a section I am making. Nothing here is final and there will be mistakes. Do not open issues about this yet.

# Do you accept donations? How do I donate?

I do not accept any donations. I will never allow any donations. If you ever see me, any of my accounts, or this project allowing donations, then that is not me and I have been hacked. Do not try to give donations to me or this project, I do not want your donations. Any attempts to donate will be immediately rejected. 

I give my sincere appreciation to anyone who has thought of donating, but I didn't make this list for money. 

Instead, I highly encourage you to donate to any of the software listed in the project. A lot of them need your donations to stay alive. I simply made a list of other people's software, which does not warrant a donation. Anyone can make a list. Give your money to the people that worked hard to make real software. 

# How can I support the project without donations?

You can support the project by:
- Reporting mistakes, typos, bad links, bad Platform badges, etc.
- Fixing mistakes by creating pull requests
- Suggesting software by opening an issue
- Spreading word about the list by word of mouth, posts online, etc.
- Making your own list inspired by this one
- Starring the repository, only because it helps boost the list in search results
- Helping translate the list into other languages
- Creating software that can be added to the list
- Helping out with the already existing software on the list
- Anything else you can think of

# Why is \<some Firefox-based browser\> not on this list?

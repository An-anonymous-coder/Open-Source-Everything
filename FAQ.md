# THIS FILE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT

**This is an early look at a section I am making. Nothing here is final and there will be mistakes. Do not open issues about this yet.**

# Do you accept donations? How do I donate?

I do not accept any donations. I will never allow any donations. If you ever see me, any of my accounts, or this project allowing donations, then that is not me and I have been hacked. Do not try to give donations to me or this project, I do not want your donations. Any attempts to donate will be immediately rejected. 

I give my sincere appreciation to anyone who has thought of donating, but I didn't make this list for money. 

Instead, I highly encourage you to donate to any of the software listed in the project. A lot of them need your donations to stay alive. I simply made a list of other people's software, which does not warrant a donation. Anyone can make a list. Give your money to the people that worked hard to make real software. 

# How can I support the project without donations?

You can support the project by:
- Reporting or fixing typos or grammar mistakes
- Reporting or fixing incorrect/broken links
- Reporting or fixing incorrect "Platform" badges
- Reporting or fixing software or sections not in alphabetical order
- Reporting software that isn't soure-available that doesn't have the "This software is proprietary" stamp
- Reporting software that is abandoned or no longer available that doesn't have the "This software is outdated or abandoned" stamp
- Reporting software that has "gone rogue"
- Suggesting alternative or better software than software already on the list
- Spreading word about the list by word of mouth, posts online, etc.
- Translating the list into other languages
- Creating software that can be added to the list
- Contributing to the actual software that is listed
- Anything else you can think of

Copying my list without making changes *does not help*, and only creates confusion for people trying to find the original, up-to-date list. Modifying this list to make it your own *is* alright, since not everyone will agree with my decisions here. The software has and always will remain under the GPLv3 license, so I have no control over what you do or don't do.

# Why is *insert some Firefox-based browser here* not on this list?

Most Firefox-based browsers cannot be recommended in good faith due to their poor implementation of per-site process isolation, [especially on Android](https://divestos.org/pages/browsers#processIsolation). Firefox *does* have an implementation called Fission, for the desktop versions of the browser, but [it is still weaker than the Chromium implementation](https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/firefox-chromium.html#sandboxing). Mullvad Browser and the Tor Browser are the only exceptions, because their privacy benefits with fingerprinting resistance outweigh the security issues.

# Why is Bitwarden not included in this list?

The decision not to include Bitwarden was thought about for a long time. The main reason they didn't make it on the list is because of their focus on business over privacy/security in some cases. An example of this is how you are required to sign up for a paid account to be able to use a hardware security key as a method of MFA. Since KeePassXC and KeePassDX both offer these for free, I decided that Bitwarden is not a good fit for the list. Consider this section in the FAQ an "honorable mention".

# Why isn't Tenacity included in this list? Wasn't Audacity bought, and has trackers?

I will be quoting some of [Tenacity's own history](https://tenacityaudio.org/docs/_content/Motivation.html#history):

"In April 2021, **Muse Group acquired the famous audio editing application Audacity.** Their goals for Audacity were to bring much needed improvements to Audacity. However, not too long after, **there was an attempt to add telemetry to the program**, spurring controversy among its community. Luckily, **the new developers backed off on their proposal**, only maintaining basic error reporting and update checking where no personal information is collected.

However, in July of 2021, **Audacity was embroiled in controversy once again with a new privacy policy**, recommending that users under the age of 13 not use the program. This raised concerns of violating Audacityâ€™s GPLv2 license. While **the new privacy policy was updated to address these concerns**, the community already had enough."

Essentially, Audacity was bought, and made some mistakes. It currently **does not** have any of those issues, and so Tenacity is not going to replace it on this list. If Audacity ever does have further issues, Tenacity will quickly replace it on this list.

# Why did you move this project from GitHub to GitLab?

I accidentally deleted the GitHub repository, and I needed somewhere to quickly get the project back up, in case GitHub couldn't restore it. GitHub requires a paid account to be able to restore deleted repositories, so it was a gamble whether GitHub support would bend the rules a bit. Thankfully, they were able to recover the project, at the cost of it falsely being marked as a fork of a different user, who had previously forked my project. GitLab seemed like a good choice since it is open source and hosts a lot of other big open source projects, but it may be moved to Codeberg in the future, due to some security concerns.

# Why are some adult content software suggestions included?

The goal of Open Source Everything is to provide the best open source options for *everything*, and this is one of very few lists that made the decision to include an adult content section. This is kept minimal, and I will rarely ever make changes to it. If you aren't alright with this, it's easy enough to ignore, or make your own list that excludes it.

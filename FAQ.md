# This file is under development

This is an early look at a section I am making. Nothing here is final and there will be mistakes. Do not open issues about this yet.

# Do you accept donations? How do I donate?

I do not accept any donations. I will never allow any donations. If you ever see me, any of my accounts, or this project allowing donations, then that is not me and I have been hacked. Do not try to give donations to me or this project, I do not want your donations. Any attempts to donate will be immediately rejected. 

I give my sincere appreciation to anyone who has thought of donating, but I didn't make this list for money. 

Instead, I highly encourage you to donate to any of the software listed in the project. A lot of them need your donations to stay alive. I simply made a list of other people's software, which does not warrant a donation. Anyone can make a list. Give your money to the people that worked hard to make real software. 

# How can I support the project without donations?

You can support the project by:
- Reporting mistakes, typos, bad links, bad Platform badges, etc.
- Fixing mistakes by creating pull requests
- Suggesting software by opening an issue
- Spreading word about the list by word of mouth, posts online, etc.
- Making your own list inspired by this one
- Starring the repository, only because it helps boost the list in search results
- Helping translate the list into other languages
- Creating software that can be added to the list
- Helping out with the already existing software on the list
- Anything else you can think of

# Why is *insert some Firefox-based browser here* not on this list?

Firefox-based browsers cannot be recommended due to the lack of per-site process isolation on Android. Firefox *does* have an implementation for the desktop versions of the browser, called Fission, but it is still weaker than the Chromium implementation. Mullvad Browser and the Tor Browser are the only exceptions, because their privacy benefits outweigh the security issues with their fingerprinting resistance.

*I am still researching this and will provide sources to back up my claims

# Why is Bitwarden not included in this list?

The decision not to include Bitwarden was thought about for a long time. The main reason they didn't make it on the list is because of their focus on business over privacy/security in some cases. An example of this is how you are required to sign up for a paid account to be able to use a hardware security key as a method of MFA. Since KeePassXC and KeePassDX both offer these for free, I decided that Bitwarden is not a good fit for the list. Consider this section in the FAQ an "honorable mention".

# Why isn't Tenacity included in this list? Wasn't Audacity bought and has trackers?

I will be quoting some of [Tenacity's own history](https://tenacityaudio.org/docs/_content/Motivation.html#history):

In April 2021, **Muse Group acquired the famous audio editing application Audacity.** Their goals for Audacity were to bring much needed improvements to Audacity. However, not too long after, **there was an attempt to add telemetry to the program**, spurring controversy among its community. Luckily, **the new developers backed off on their proposal**, only maintaining basic error reporting and update checking where no personal information is collected.

However, in July of 2021, **Audacity was embroiled in controversy once again with a new privacy policy**, recommending that users under the age of 13 not use the program. This raised concerns of violating Audacityâ€™s GPLv2 license. While **the new privacy policy was updated to address these concerns**, the community already had enough.

Essentially, Audacity was bought and made some mistakes. It currently does not have any of these issues, and so Tenacity is not going to replace it on this list. If Audacity ever does have issues, this will quickly be changed. 

# Why did you move this project from GitHub to GitLab?

I accidentally deleted the GitHub repository, and I needed somewhere to quickly get the project back up in case GitHub couldn't restore it. GitHub requires a paid account to be able to restore deleted repositories, so it was a gamble whether or not GitHub support would bend the rules a bit. Thankfully, they were able to recover the project, at the cost of it falsely being marked as a fork of a different user who had previously forked my project. GitLab seemed like a good choice since it is open source and hosts a lot of other big open source projects, but it may be moved to Codeberg in the future due to some security vulnerabilities.

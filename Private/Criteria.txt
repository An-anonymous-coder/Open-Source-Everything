For my own sanity, I'm going to put together a rough outline for what makes software "best" software.
These are not hard and fast rules, and there are plenty of exceptions.
This is simply to help me make hard decisions.

Ideal software in general:
- Recommended often
- Widely used (or used by reputable organizations)
- Industry standard or only available option
- Written in OS-standard programming language (C#, Swift, Kotlin, etc.)
- Uses OS-standard design language (Fluent Design System, Material Design, Liquid Glass, etc.)
- Free (as in free beer; gtatis)
- Free (as in freedom; libre)
- Respects rights (e.g. Privacy respecting, no forced agreements, responsible use of network permission)
- Fully open source
- Source code hosted on open source platforms (GitLab, Codeberg, etc.)
- Fully reproducable builds
- Fully featured
- Has one purpose (e.g. Not a jack-of-all-trades)
- Modern code (e.g. Vulkan is a modern successor to OpenGL)
- Actively maintained
- Responsible developers
- Interoperable
- Cross-platform
- Available on platforms that make sense (e.g. Navigation apps would make more sense on a phone than a computer)
- No personal information required (accounts, etc.)
- Available for secure operating systems (secureblue, GrapheneOS, Qubes OS, etc.)
- No regional restrictions
- Useful software (e.g. Not software that has become obselete or a default OS feature)
- Would help during an apocalypse

Ideal software for websites:
- Runs on secure browsers fully hardened (Vanadium, Trivalent, Tor Browser)
- Runs without any permissions (JavaScript included)
- Doesn't ban IPs (Tor, VPN, etc.)
- Available as .onion and .i2p
- No captchas (including Cloudflare)
- User respecting (no cookie consent banners, no popups, no malicious redirects, cross-platform, etc.)
- Dynamic dark/light mode set by the OS (e.g. with `prefers-color-scheme`)

The ideal software for Linux:
- Written in Rust
- Adwaita themed
- GTK
- Wayland windowing system
- Available to install from Flathub (verified)
- Works on fully hardened secureblue
- Works with all Flatpak permissions disabled
- Part of the GNOME Circle (https://circle.gnome.org/)

The ideal software for Android:
- Written in Kotlin
- Material 3 Expressive themed
- Jetpack Compose
- Available to install from Accrescent
- Works without Google Play Services
- Works on GrapheneOS with all permissions disabled
- Verified by AppVerifier

For my own sanity, I'm going to put together a rough outline for what makes software "best" software.
These are not hard and fast rules, and there are plenty of exceptions.
This is simply to help me make hard decisions.

- No account required
- Works offline
- Fully featured
- Good UI
- Interoperable (i.e. import export in standard formats)
- Available for multiple platforms
- Recommended often by the community
- Very popular or used often
- Open source (obviously)
- Actively maintained
- Responsible developers
- Available for secure app stores (e.g. Accrescent)
- Respects rights (e.g. respects privacy, no ToS, no privacy policy, no cookies, responsible use of network permission)
- Only available option or universal standard
- Modern (e.g. Vulkan is a modern OpenGL implementation)
- Would help in an apocalypse (yes, this is a real criteria. It works surprisingly well)
- Compatibility with hardened operating systems (e.g. GrapheneOS)

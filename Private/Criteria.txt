For my own sanity, I'm going to put together a rough outline for what makes software "best" software.
These are not hard and fast rules, and there are plenty of exceptions.
This is simply to help me make hard decisions.

Best case-scenario:
- Free (gratis)
- No account required
- Airgapped
- Fully featured
- Modern UI (e.g. Material Design 3)
- Interoperable
- Cross-platform
- Recommended often
- Very popular
- Open source
- Actively maintained
- Responsible developers
- Released to secure stores (e.g. Accrescent, Flathub)
- Respects rights (e.g. Privacy respecting, no forced agreements, responsible use of network permission)
- Standard or only available option
- Modern code (e.g. Vulkan is a modern successor to OpenGL)
- Would help during an apocalypse (yes, this is a real criteria. It works surprisingly well)
- Compatibile with hardened operating systems by default (e.g. GrapheneOS, secureblue, Qubes OS)
- Available on platforms that make sense (e.g. Camera apps are generally undesirable on a desktop)
- Useful software (e.g. Not software has become obselete or a default OS feature)
- Dark theme (and AMOLED theme)
- Has one purpose (e.g. Not a jack-of-all-trades)
